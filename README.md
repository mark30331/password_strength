# password_strength
a program to compute the strength of a password.
This program would first prompt the user for their password. With this string, determine how many combinations of passwords exist in this set. In other words, given the length of the password (length of the string) and the complexity of the password (numbers, letters, and symbols), how large is the set of passwords represented by the userâ€™s example?
